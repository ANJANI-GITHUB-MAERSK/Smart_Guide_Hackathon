**Smart Guide: "Intelligent Manual Retrieval System: AI-Powered Solution for Instant Access to Industrial Equipment Operation, Maintenance, and Troubleshooting Information**

Problem Statement In large industrial or operational environments, workers and engineers often need quick, accurate access to information from equipment manuals to ensure safe, efficient, 
and correct handling, maintenance, and troubleshooting of machinery. However, these manuals are often extensive, spread across various systems, and not easily searchable, making it challenging 
for personnel to quickly find specific answers to their questions.

Solution proposal: Develop a GenAI-powered system that centralizes all equipment manuals into a single searchable data source. This system would allow users to ask natural language questions 
about equipment operation, maintenance, troubleshooting, and specifications. By leveraging AIâ€™s ability to understand and retrieve contextually relevant information, the system will provide clear, 
concise answers directly from the manual data. This solution aims to reduce downtime, improve safety, and enhance user efficiency by offering on-demand, reliable access to critical information.
